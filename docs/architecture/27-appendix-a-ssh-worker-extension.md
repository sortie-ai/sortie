## Appendix A. SSH Worker Extension (Optional)

This appendix describes a common extension profile in which Sortie keeps one central orchestrator
but executes worker runs on one or more remote hosts over SSH.

### A.1 Execution Model

- The orchestrator remains the single source of truth for polling, claims, retries, and
  reconciliation.
- `worker.ssh_hosts` provides the candidate SSH destinations for remote execution.
- Each worker run is assigned to one host at a time, and that host becomes part of the run's
  effective execution identity along with the issue workspace.
- `workspace.root` is interpreted on the remote host, not on the orchestrator host. The
  orchestrator validates workspace safety invariants locally (path sanitization, no traversal)
  and trusts the remote host to enforce filesystem permissions.
- The coding-agent is launched over SSH stdio instead of as a local subprocess, so the orchestrator
  still owns the session lifecycle even though commands execute remotely.
- Continuation turns inside one worker lifetime should stay on the same host and workspace.
- A remote host should satisfy the same basic contract as a local worker environment: reachable
  shell, writable workspace root, coding-agent executable, and any required auth or repository
  prerequisites.

### A.2 Scheduling Notes

- SSH hosts may be treated as a pool for dispatch.
- Implementations may prefer the previously used host on retries when that host is still available.
- `worker.max_concurrent_agents_per_host` is an optional shared per-host cap across configured SSH
  hosts.
- When all SSH hosts are at capacity, dispatch should wait rather than silently falling back to a
  different execution mode.
- Implementations may fail over to another host when the original host is unavailable before work
  has meaningfully started.
- Once a run has already produced side effects, a transparent rerun on another host should be
  treated as a new attempt, not as invisible failover.

### A.3 Problems to Consider

- Remote environment drift:
  - Each host needs the expected shell environment, coding-agent executable, auth, and repository
    prerequisites.
- Workspace locality:
  - Workspaces are usually host-local, so moving an issue to a different host is typically a cold
    restart unless shared storage exists.
- Path and command safety:
  - Remote path resolution, shell quoting, and workspace-boundary checks matter more once execution
    crosses a machine boundary.
- Startup and failover semantics:
  - Implementations should distinguish host-connectivity/startup failures from in-workspace agent
    failures so the same ticket is not accidentally re-executed on multiple hosts.
- Host health and saturation:
  - A dead or overloaded host should reduce available capacity, not cause duplicate execution or an
    accidental fallback to local work.
- Cleanup and observability:
  - Operators need to know which host owns a run, where its workspace lives, and whether cleanup
    happened on the right machine.
